Custom domain
Custom domain
Custom domains allow you to serve your site from a domain other than vishalkadam2003.github.io. Learn more about configuring custom domains.

 

Enforce HTTPS
— Required for your site because you are using the default domain (vishalkadam2003.github.io)
HTTPS provides a layer of encryption that prevents others from snooping on or tampering with traffic to your site.
When HTTPS is enforced, your site will only be served over HTTPS. Learn more about securing your GitHub Pages site with HTTPS.
